# Digital Waveguide Mesh with Microphone Array output

This is repository consists of a Digital Waveguide Mesh (DWM) implementation based mainly on the K-DWM implementation described in _Kelloniemi, Antti. "Frequency-dependent boundary condition for the 3-D digital waveguide mesh." Proc. Int. Conf. Digital Audio Effects (DAFx’06). 2006._

The implementation allows for processing of multiple input sources and the capture of multiple outputs from a "virtual microphone array".
